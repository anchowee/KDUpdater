KDTools 2 is being developed from scratch. Many classes from KDTools 1
have been superseeded by Qt 4. Where KDTools 1 classes still make
sense in Qt 4, we are in the process of porting and redesigning them,
and they are expected to return in future KDTools 2 releases.

Some of the major new features and advantages in KDTools 2.0 are: 

New Classes
===========

* KDSignalBlocker (Core)
  Exception-safe and convenient wrapper around QObject::blockSignals().
* KDSignalSpy (Core)
  QSignalSpy that records all signals emitted from an object (or list
  of object).
* KDLog/KDLogDevice (Core)
  Redesigned KDLogger. See porting.txt for details. 
* KDRect (Core)
  Rectangle convenience functions. 
* KDPainterSaver (Gui)
  Exception-safe and convenient wrapper around
  QPainter::save()/restore(). 
* KDOverriderCursor (Gui)
  Exception-safe and convenient wrapper around
  QApplication::setOverrideCursor().
* KDColorButton (Gui)
  A color display and selection widget.
* KDLogTextWidget (Gui)
  High-speed text display widget to replace Qt3's QTextEdit::LogText
  mode.
* KDPropertyView (Gui)
  A property browser component.
* KDShortcutBar (Gui)
  This widget provides a vertical list of buttons, one for each
  shortcut, and an area that displays a widget for each shortcut.
  The list of buttons and the widget area are separated by a splitter.
  The list of buttons can be contracted and expanded to display more
  or less buttons by the user.
* KDTimeLineArea (Gui)
  A widget that shows events in a timeline. 

Build System / Packaging
========================

KDTools is now separated into KDToolsCore (depending only on QtCore)
and KDToolsGui (depending on QtGui) libraries. It has a new build
system, and can be used from qmake-based projects with, e.g.,

  CONFIG += kdtools
  KDTOOLS = core gui

as a consequence.
