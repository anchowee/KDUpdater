KDLogTextWidget
------------------------

- The 'lines' property isn't available in Designer from Qt 4.1.
  This is due to a limitation of that designer version which does
  not allow to edit QStringList properties.


KDColorButton
------------------------

- The "Pick A Color From Screen" action fails to grab the mouse in Qt
  versions 4.5.x (at least x <= 2) with debug output "grabMouse() failed
  with \"GrabInvalidTime\". This is a regression in Qt 4.5, and has been
  reported to Nokia Qt-Software.
