// These two macros can be used to force the loading of static objects in static libraries.
// Under normal circumstances, the linker automatically discards unused library symbols from the final executable,
// which is a problem for static objects with a constructor performing a specific action such as registration.
// Note that the export macro only needs to be included once per .cpp file (even if there are many static objects in the file).
// Parameters :
// - ID : an file-wide identifier, e.g. the filename without the extension.
//        It shouldn't be quoted, no spaces, and contain only alphanumerical characters.
