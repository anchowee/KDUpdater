  \defgroup unittest KDUnitTest
  \since_l 2.1

  KDUnitTest is a small unit test framework that is designed to be as
  simple as possible, but not simpler. KDUnitTest works best for
  unit-testing of non-GUI classes, although it is extensible enough to
  meet most needs. Its only dependencies are the standard C++
  library. Qt is needed only for some macros, there are no runtime
  dependencies on Qt.

  KDUnitTest currently supports only textual output, but XML as well
  as custom output formats are planned for a future release.

  \sect Terminology

  A KDUnitTest run consists of executing \em tests in all or a subset
  of \em groups. Groups are simple path-like strings, such as
  "kdtools", "kdtools/core", etc. If you run all tests in "kdtools",
  that would include the tests in "kdtools/core", too. One Test may
  contain an arbitrary number of \em checks. A check is the smallest
  unit that can be reported on. A test, on the other hand, is the
  smallest unit of \em execution.

  \sect Simple Usage

  In the simplest case, when your setup and teardown code is trivial,
  usage is as simple as adding

  \code
  #ifndef KDAB_NO_UNIT_TESTS
  #include <KDUnitTest/Test>
  KDAB_UNITTEST_SIMPLE( QString, "Qt/Core/Tools" ) {
     const QString null, empty(""), foo("Foo");
     assertTrue( null.isNull() );
     assertTrue( null.isEmpty() );
     assertFalse( empty.isNull() );
     assertTrue( empty.isEmpty() );
     assertEqual( foo.length(), 3 );
  }
  #endif / KDAB_NO_UNIT_TESTS
  \endcode

  to your implementation file.

  A failed check (assert*()) does not cause the following checks to be
  skipped. If you need that behaviour, add a guard:
  \code
  assertFalse( empty.isNull() );
  if ( !empty.isNull() )
      assertEqual( *empty.data(), QChar('\0') );
  \endcode

  To run the tests, instantiate a KDUnitTest::Runner and call \link
  KDUnitTest::Runner::run() run()\endlink on it:
  \code
  KDUnitTest::Runner runner;
  const unsigned int numFailed = runner.run();
  \endcode

  You can add this code to your application's main() function, or as
  part of a dedicated test runner. It will find all the tests by
  itself and execute them all (but see the section on static libraries
  below).

  \sect Extended Usage

  If you need more control over the test runs, you can write your own
  KDUnitTest::Test subclass (instead of using the one that
  KDAB_UNITTEST_SIMPLE() creates for you), and use the constructor for
  setup and the destructor for teardown functionality. You would then
  use KDAB_EXPORT_UNITTEST() or KDUnitTest::GenericFactory directly,
  to make the test known to KDUnitTest::TestRegistry:

  \code
  #ifndef KDAB_NO_UNIT_TESTS
  #include <KDUnitTest/Test>
  class MyTest : public KDUnitTest::Test {
      QFile file;
  public:
      MyTest()
          : KDUnitTest::Test( "my test" ),
            file( "testdata.dat" )
      {
          file.open( QIODevice::ReadOnly );
      }
      void run() {
          if ( !file.isOpen() ) {
              fail( __FILE__, __LINE__ )
                  << "Could not open file testdata.dat: "
                  << qPrintable( file.errorString() ) ;
              return;
          }
          // checks go here...
      }
      ~MyTest() {
          file.close();
      }
  };
  KDAB_EXPORT_UNITTEST( MyTest, "my group" );
  #endif // KDAB_NO_UNIT_TESTS
  \endcode

  \sect Unit Tests in Static Libraries

  When using a dedicated test runner application, it is most
  convenient to dynamically link the libraries that contain the test
  code. This way, you just have to add new libraries to the linker
  line, and all tests are automatically discovered by
  KDUnitTest::TestRegistry through the use of static initializers.

  When using static libraries, and esp. when using a dedicated test
  runner application (as opposed to the application you're writing
  itself), chances are that the linker will omit most if not all of
  your translation units from the final executable, as nothing in the
  test runner directly references symbols from those translation
  units.

  In this case, you need to add KDAB_IMPORT_UNITTEST() calls to the
  source code of the test runner application to force the linker to
  include the test code in the test runner executable:

  \code
  #include <KDUnitTest/Runner>
  #include <KDUnitTest/Test>

  KDAB_IMPORT_UNITTEST( Test1 );
         :
  KDAB_IMPORT_UNITTEST( TestN );

  int main( int argc, char * argv[] ) {
      // ... init ...

      KDUnitTest::Runner runner;
      return runner.run( argc == 1 ? 0 : argv[1] );
  }
  \endcode

  Use this macro to register your \link KDUnitTest::Test Test\endlink
